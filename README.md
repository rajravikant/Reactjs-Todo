# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# todo object which will be inputed by user
# const todo = [] list as a state which can be 
    added a todo
    update a todo
    delete a todo

# for this we will use {useDispatch} hook 
# there will be context for avoiding prop chains
# will use local storage for storing the todo[] array
# useEffect() will be used for storing each object in the todo array
